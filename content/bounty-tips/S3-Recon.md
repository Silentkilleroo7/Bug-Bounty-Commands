### Method 1:
Google Dork to find S3 Buckets  <br>
site: s3.amazonaws.com site.com  <br>
site:amazonaws.com inurl:.s3.amazonaws.com  <br>
site:s3.amazonaws.com intitle:index.of.bucket  <br>

### Method 2:
Using Burp Suite  <br>
Crawl the whole application through the browser proxy and then discover the S3 buckets from the sitemap feature of the Burp suite. Look for web addresses or special headers that mention S3 buckets, like "s3.amazonaws.com" or "x-am-bucket".

### Method 3:
From Application  <br>
To find the target application's S3 bucket, right-click on any image available on the application, open it in a new tab, and check if the image URL format is something like this: "https://name.s3.amazonaws.com" In this case, "name" before ".s3" is the bucket name where the images or data is stored.
